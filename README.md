# TypeScript Definitions for `check-error`

This repository is like a staging area so I can easily test type definitions
before submitting to DefinitelyTyped.

`check-error` is a package for retrieving an `Error`'s information such as its
`message` or `constructor` name. It can also check whether two Errors are
compatible based on their messages, constructors, or instances.

-- According to its README.

This library has been branched off from Chai assertion library. As of this
writing, it has not received any updates since October 2016, but the main
Chai assertion library still depends on it as of v4.2.0.
